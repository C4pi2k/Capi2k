Hey there, my Name is Capi

I am 21 y/o, I am from Switzerland and currently doing a 2 year long apprenticeship as a Software Engineer.
At my company I am working with Java on our product, which means I am working a lot OOP and am rather familiar with.
I do have a certain interest in programming in general, which leads to me studying certain languages on my own, such as JS and GO.

Although I gotta admit I only started coing in summer of 2021, which means I am still learning a lot all the time
